I.Abstract
There are a lot of shell, and they are different depend on their OS:
Wins - powershell
macOS - zsh: z shell
linuxOS - bash: Bourne Again Shell

Since macOs and linuxOS are both built base on the Unix family, many command in 
zsh & bash 're the same

Turn file to script file
which bash/python3

test.py
>>>#! usr/bin/env python3 : shebang
chmod a+x test.py
./test.py

test.sh
#!/bin/bash : shebang
chmod a+x test.sh
./test.sh

II. Basic Linux commands
man: show manual 
eg: man mv

cat file.txt: check file content

mv(move): mv <src> <dst> mv myfile.txt dir1/

cp(copy): cp <src> <dst> cp myfile.txt myfile1.txt

rm(remove): rm -rf dir/

touch file.txt: create new file

mkdir dir(make directory): create new dir

cd(change directory): cd .., cd dir/, cd /, cd ~

id: print info about the current user

ps(process status): lists the processes executing in the current terminal for the current user
    ps ax: lists all processes currently executing for all users  
    ps e: shows the environment for the processes listed  

kill PID: sends the SIGTERM signal to the process identified by PID

chmod(change mode): chmod [options] [mode] [File_name]
1) Symbolic mode
+ : add permission
- : remove permission
= : set permission -> specific
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
r : read
w : write
x : execute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
u : owner
o : others
g : group
a : all
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VD: chmod u=rwx file.txt: owner read, write, execute
    chmod go-w [file_name]: remove write from others and group
2) Octal mode
4 : read
2 : write
1 : execute
VD: chmod 777 file.txt == a=rwx
    chmod 674 file.txt == u=rw, g=rwx, o=r

cut: Dùng để cắt chuỗi theo cột cố định cut -d'DELIMITER' -fFIELD_NUMBER

awk '{print $1}': Mạnh hơn, hỗ trợ điều kiện & xử lý logic

sort: sort the output

lsof -i :9000 -t: t: trích ra port, i: trích ra TCP/IP -> trích ra PID dùng port 9000

fg: causes a job that was stopped or in the background to return to the foreground

bg: causes a job that was stopped to go to the background

jobs: lists the jobs currently running or stopped

top: shows the processes currently using the most CPU time (press "q" to quit)  

III. Redirections, Pipes, and Signals
command > file: redirects standard output, overwrites file

command >> file: redirects standard output, appends to file

command < file: redirects standard input from file

command 2> file: redirects standard error to file

command1 | command2: connects the output of command1 to the input of command2
